This program I will be making is a simple market place program. This program will let a user make a psudo account and Display user account details. as well as interact with other areas of the marketplace regardless of them being developed or not.

This program will:
-let the user create a user-name
-let the user create a password
-display the different options for the main menu
-display the user's Account details when entering in the option
-exit program when entering 0 from the main menu

Application notes:
Some areas of the app will have a "Still in development" prompt. This is normal.

The user-name and password do not have validation allowing the user to create a user-name of any length and password of any length.
