# ClassWork_Spring2020
A collection of course work using the Java language

***At the time of writing this I will have completed my sophomore year at Central Washington University in the year of 2020***

**Inside the CS110 folder is a collection of works when attending Central Washington University.
The assignments that I had to go through involve using if/if else/if else if/for()/while() and Switch Case.
These projects include:**

- ExampleFile.java(**When I need to *see* what a given structure would output and or look like I use this file to better understand it**)

- CastExample.java(**Originally this file was supposed to be the example file** but I had already saved the file as is and didn't bother with it. But this file serves as an **example for casting between different variables**)
- ForLoopAsciiArt.java(**This file was created so that I can use a for loop to produce a triangle using a type char variable such as the @ symbol**)

**I could list out all of the files here but I feel like the files listed show what I am capable of when using Java and there are more projects within the CS110 file. Albeit basic structures this is just the beginning as I am always looking to improve.**


**Prior to using Java I have experience with using C# to work in the Unity Engine. While using unity I have made a total of 2 personal games and 1 personal group game using the Unreal Engine. A practice exercise of sorts to get me a bit more familiar with using C# in the Unity engine and using blueprints within the Unreal Engine. I also have experience using Unreal Engine's blueprinting system.**
